Path to learning Python

If you're reading this, hello!

I'm a college student who's about to graduate and I want to learn Python. From what I understand, it's a really valuable programming language to know, especially in the field of finance. I also realize that when it comes to hedge funds like Renaissance Technologies making insane returns in the stock market, there's a lot more than just Python going on behind the scenes. I'm looking forward to this journey, and some topics of interest to me currently include:

- Bulge Bracket banks using Python and R for pricing models
- Algorithmic trading
- Artificial Intelligence
- Machine Learning
